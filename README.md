File Copier Tool
Description
This Node.js application allows users to select and copy files via a web interface to a designated directory on the server. It uses Express for the backend, Multer for handling file uploads, and CORS to allow cross-origin requests.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If Node.js is not installed, download and install it from Node.js official website.

Installation
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://yourrepositoryurl.com/path/to/repo.git
cd repo
Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and run:
bash
Copy code
npm install
This command installs all necessary packages defined in package.json.
Running the Server
To start the server, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
This will start the server on port 3000 (or another port if configured). You can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Use the file selector to choose a file you want to copy.
Click the "Copy File" button to send the file to the server.
The server will copy the file to the data directory within the server's file structure.
Contributing
For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

Notes
Repository URL: Replace https://yourrepositoryurl.com/path/to/repo.git with your actual repository URL.
Node.js Installation Link: It's always a good practice to link directly to official resources for tools like Node.js.
Scripts and Testing: If your application has more complex functionalities or other scripts, you might want to add additional sections in the README describing how to run these scripts or conduct tests.
This README provides a basic structure that you can expand based on the specifics of your project or any additional commands and functionalities your application might require.
